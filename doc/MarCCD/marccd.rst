MarCCD class
====================

**MarCCD** is the generic class and it provides a unique interface to control any supported camera. One can find below the 
properties, commands, and attributes. 

To run a MarCCD device you will need at least to configure the **DetectorType** property. This property is used by the LimaDetector device to communicate with the proper camera plugin. Please refer a specific camera (e.g Basler) device chapter for further information.
